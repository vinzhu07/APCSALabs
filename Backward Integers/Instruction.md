**Backward Integers**

The purpose of this lab is to prompt the user for a positive integer that has at least 4 digits and print it out backward.

1. Set up a scanner object and ask the user to input an integer.
2. Check whether or not the integer is at least four digits long and positive. If not, continuously prompt the user to do so.
3. Once the integer is 4 digits long and positive, print the digits one by one from the back to the front using the math mod operator. This will require another loop.
4. Use a sentinel to repeat the entire program.  Ask the user whether they want to run this program again.  If they enter the sentinel (of your choice), run the program again.  Otherwise, thank them for using your program and end the program.



Document that your code works properly:

- Show that the user input is validated even if multiple invalid inputs occur
- Sufficiently test your processing of the digits
- Show that your program will loop and allow multiple tests in one run

Show one complete run of the program followed by the source code.
